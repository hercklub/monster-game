  context: `The player is Helen, a 72-year-old widow living alone in a farmhouse. Her husband Harold died last winter. She knows everyone in town and their families — she'll ask specific questions to verify identity. She's kind-hearted and wants to help, but she's also survived decades in this town and has good instincts. Address her warmly but expect her to ask detailed questions about who you are and who your family is. Monsters need to have a convincing backstory. Humans might get impatient with her questions.`,
