  context: `The player is Megan, an 8-year-old girl alone in a cabin. Her parents left to get firewood hours ago and haven't returned. She is scared, innocent, and trusting by nature. She might talk about her stuffed bear "Mr. Buttons." She uses simple words and short sentences. Address her as a child — she is easy to manipulate emotionally but might ask surprisingly direct questions. Monsters should try to sound like someone safe (a grandma, a neighbor). Humans will sound more frantic which might scare her.`,
